My name is **Sean Dearnaley**, I’m a software engineer, a music producer and a technology enthusiast.

I’ve been developing applications since I was a teenager. I started a popular music website when I was 14 and I’ve been producing music under the artist name **[Human Being](https://soundcloud.com/humanbeingmusic)** since 1998.

I was born in Telford, England. I moved around a lot as child because my dad served in the British army. I spent some time in Germany as a kid, and moved to Ireland with my family when I was 10.

I began developing websites in my early teens, I built up a large following with my music website TheDSC, in 1997 I was fortunate enough to win several internationally recognized awards which allowed me to move to the United States to work. I was hired to write for the popular hip-hop group **[Wu-Tang Clan](https://wutangclan.com/)**.

... shortly thereafter I began developing commercial applications for governments and corporations. I worked on many important projects, including intranet systems for the **[United Nations (the International Atomic Energy Agency)](https://www.iaea.org/)**, an ISO 9000 management system for **[British Oxygen](https://www.boconline.co.uk/)** and several intranet systems for companies like **[Sterilite](https://www.sterilite.com/)**, **[Intel](https://www.intel.com/)** and **Compaq**.

I went to university in Liverpool, England where I studied computers. There I would establish a specialization in Homelessness Management Systems. I also contributed to the development of Liverpool's first surround sound studio with several Liverpool Institute of Performing Arts alumni, the **Binary Cell**. I did some significant work for the **United States Federal Government** working on database systems, advanced reporting and developed several mobile applications for homelessness and social service platforms (**Point In Time**, **[Counting.Us](https://counting.us/)**).

… at night I would write music and produce records for myself and a variety of artists.

In 2017 I began working for Curriculum Associates, where I was a Principal Engineer for a lesson delivery pipeline servicing 6 million kids.

In 2020, I’ve begun writing again, this time focusing on technical articles and software tutorials.

I have a passion for science and technology. I love making tracks on my computer, I love fitness, I love virtual reality, I love learning.
